# Bugs

One belt cannot end into another

Watch out that multiple touching points dont screw up the order
 	-> Construct example such that the belt must touch the following in order
    		a) touch point of order 1
    		b) multi-touch-point of order 3
    		c) touch point of order 2
    		d) another multi-touch-point of order 3


# Factorio-specifics

    * Two inserters with belt inbetween may reduce to one inserter
    * Electric power source as input specification, with reachable-within-distance constraint
